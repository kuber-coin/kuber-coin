This directory contains deterministic test vectors covering:

- KVM opcode execution  
- Signature validation  
- Hashing correctness  
- State root generation  
- MintProof correctness  
- P2P message serialization  
- Consensus prevote/precommit rules  
- Block header hashing  

All vectors are reproducible and MUST pass on all Kuber Core implementations.
